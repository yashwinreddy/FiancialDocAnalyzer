# üìä Financial Report Analyzer (FastAPI + CrewAI)

An API to analyze and search inside financial reports (PDFs) using **FastAPI**, **CrewAI**, and **OpenAI**.

---

## üêõ Bugs Found and How They Were Fixed

1. **Missing `.env` Handling**
   - **Bug:** API keys were hardcoded or missing.
   - **Fix:** Added `.env` support using `python-dotenv`. Now `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `CREWAI_API_KEY` are securely loaded.

2. **Wrong Imports**
   - **Bug:** Incorrect imports for CrewAI tools (`pdfsearch_tool` not properly imported).
   - **Fix:** Updated imports to use `from crewai_tools import PDFSearchTool`.

3. **Inefficient Prompts**
   - **Bug:** Original prompts were too verbose and unfocused, leading to irrelevant answers.
   - **Fix:** Rewrote prompts to be concise and role-specific.
     Example:
     ```python
     system_prompt = "You are a financial analyst. Summarize the uploaded financial report focusing on revenue, expenses, and key insights."
     ```

4. **PDF Handling**
   - **Bug:** Uploaded PDF was not read correctly by CrewAI.
   - **Fix:** Ensured file saving, path handling, and correct parsing via `PDFSearchTool`.

5. **FastAPI Response Issues**
   - **Bug:** API endpoints sometimes returned raw Python objects.
   - **Fix:** Ensured all responses return JSON (`JSONResponse` or `dict`).
